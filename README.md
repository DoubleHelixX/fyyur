Fyyur
-----

### Introduction

Fyyur is a musical venue and artist booking site that facilitates the discovery and bookings of shows between local performing artists and venues. This site lets you list new artists and venues, discover them, and list shows with artists as a venue owner.

Your job is to build out the data models to power the API endpoints for the Fyyur site by connecting to a PostgreSQL database for storing, querying, and creating information about artists and venues on Fyyur.

### Overview

This app contains views and controllers that are interacting with models, which store, retrieve, and update data from a database. 
The project works with PostgreSQL database in order to do the following:

* creating new venues, artists, and creating new shows.
* searching for venues and artists.
* learning more about a specific artist or venue.
* Artist availability. An artist can list available times that they can be booked. Restrict venues from being able to create shows with artists during a show time that is   outside of their availability.
* Show Recent Listed Artists and Recently Listed Venues on the homepage, returning results for Artists and Venues sorting by newly created. Limit to the 10 most recently listed items.
* Implement Search Artists by City and State, and Search Venues by City and State. Searching by "San Francisco, CA" should return all artists or venues in San Francisco, CA.

Fyyur is to be the next new platform that artists and musical venues can use to find each other, and discover new music shows. Check it out!

  $ cd YOUR_PROJECT_DIRECTORY_PATH/
  $ virtualenv --no-site-packages env
  $ source env/bin/activate
  ```

2. Install the dependencies:
  ```
  $ pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
3. Migration of database is optional:
  ```
  $ flask db init
  $ flask db migrate
  $ flask db upgrade
  ```
4. Run the development server:
  ```
  $ export FLASK_APP=myapp
  $ export FLASK_ENV=development # enables debug mode
  $ python3 app.py
  ```

5. Navigate to Home page [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)
